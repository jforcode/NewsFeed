Things to do:

- webview
- bookmarks
- sort by time
- filter by category
- show category on top of list items
- process for grouping on time
- use drawerLayout for a Image, Home, Bookmarks, Credits (icons and stuff), Settings (maybe)
- offline view (prioritize for last, anyway currently everything is being done from local db)
